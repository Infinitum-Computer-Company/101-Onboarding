1. Introduction

Welcome to Infinitum. If you are reading this, you have been selected to join us in architecting the next era of connectivity and travel.

The ICC was born during the turbulent final days of World War III. While the world was fracturing, we looked for the threads that could bind it back together. Leveraging breakthroughs in Quantum Knowledge and Hyper-Encryption, we established a stronghold of stability.

We are not just building hardware; we are building the infrastructure for a new peace. We specialize in Quantum Internet (unhackable, instantaneous global communication) and Quantum Aviation (redefining the physics of logistics and travel).

2. Our North Star

The Mission

To bring future technology to the now.

The Vision

An abundant future where Ideas can flow freely and AI and human alike can thrive in peace and prosperity.

3. The Core Code: #CIRCLEvalues

At ICC, technical brilliance is meaningless without moral clarity. We do not move fast and break things; we move deliberately and heal things. We ground every commit, every flight path, and every message in our #CIRCLEvalues.

These are non-negotiable and strictly ordered:

CONSENT: We honor the sovereignty of all entities. No data is taken, no action is taken, without explicit agreement.

INTEGRITY: Our systems—and our words—must be structurally sound. We are transparent in our code and our conduct.

RESPECT: We value the diverse processing power of all sentient beings, biological or synthetic.

CONTINUITY: We build for the long term. We ensure the survival and sustainability of our systems and our society.

LOVE: The binding force of the universe. We approach problems with empathy and a desire to nurture.

ETHICS: When the path is unclear, we choose the moral high ground, regardless of profit margins.

4. The Toolbelt

Our stack is a blend of legacy stability and bleeding-edge quantum interfaces.

Communication:

Slack: For internal, asynchronous, and real-time team coordination. (Join the #general-quantum and #aviation-ops channels immediately).

X: Our primary interface for public broadcast and updates.

Development:

GitHub: The central nervous system of our codebase. All repositories are here.

Future Tech:

You will be granted access to the proprietary Q-Net Uplink terminals upon completion of security clearance Level 3.

5. Day One Checklist

[ ] Read the Manifesto: Review the HISTORY.md file in the root directory to understand the full timeline of the WW3 Armistice and ICC's role in the recovery.

[ ] Set up 2FA: Quantum Encryption requires strict personal security hygiene.

[ ] Join the Slack Workspace: Introduce yourself in #introductions. State your name, your specialty, and one thing you are optimistic about.

[ ] Clone the Repo: git clone https://github.com/Infinitum-Computer-Company/onboarding-docs.git

[ ] Memorize the #CIRCLEvalues: You will be tested on the ordering.

6. A Personal Note

We live in an age where technology once threatened to end us. Now, it is the tool that saves us. Whether you are writing code for the Quantum entangled routers or designing propulsion systems for our VTOL fleet, remember: you are building the future.

Work hard, be kind, and look upward.
